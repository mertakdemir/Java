        Wrapper Class

        Non-primitive have "methods", this is useful and good.
        We can do many actions by using "methods", this is good.
        But Primitives do not have any "methods" because of that we cannot do any actions with primitives.
        Java created a new structure which has "primitive value" and "methods" together,
        that new structure is called "Wrapper Class"

        Wrapper classes are "Non-Primitive data types.

        Primitive      Wrapper Class
        byte             Byte
        short           Short
        int            Integer
        long            Long
        float          Float
        double        Double
        boolean       Boolean
        char          Character

         We can add methods to primitive data-types and by adding methods they become non-primitive.
