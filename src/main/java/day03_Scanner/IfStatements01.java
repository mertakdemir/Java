//If statement: We sometimes need to execute some codes under some specific conditions
//   If it rains, I will cancel the picnic


//Example 1: Type code to print "negative" for the numbers less than zero, "non-negative" for the numbers greater than or equal to zero.

        double d = 2.3;

        if (d < 0) {
            System.out.println("Negative");
        }
        if (d >= 0) {
            System.out.println("Non-negative");
        }

//Example 2: Type code to print "Divisible by 5" if the number can be divided by 5, otherwise print "Not divisible by 5" if the number cannot be
//divided by 5. In java "==" means equals. % (modulus operator) ==> gives the remainder of a division operation. In java "=" is assignment operator.
        int i = 1505;

        //1.way: Multiple if statements

        if (i % 5 == 0) {

            System.out.println("Divisible by 5");

        }
        if (i % 5 != 0) {  // "!" means "NOT" in Java!.
            System.out.println("Not divisible by 5");
        }

        //2.way: If else statements ==>use it if you have just two conditions
//In the second way Java checks just 1 condition, but in the first Java checks 2 conditions.
//If you type the code in the second firstly, you will prevent repetition and secondly Java will execute your code faster.

        int k = 16;
        if (k % 5 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Divisible by 5");
        }else{
            System.out.println("Non divisible by 5");
        }
