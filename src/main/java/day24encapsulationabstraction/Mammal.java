         Normally child class must override all "abstract methods" from the parent class.
         Even Mammal class did not override anything from the Animal class, no complaining.

          Because "Overriding abstract methods from parent" is mandatory just for "Concrete Classes"

          "Overriding abstract methods from parent" is NOT mandatory for abstract classes

          If you want you can override abstract methods from parent Animal to Mammal, it is optional.
